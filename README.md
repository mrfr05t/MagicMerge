<h2>🗳️ Features:</h2>

**Stealthy Embedding**
- Description: MagicMerge allows for the embedding of executables directly within image files, creating an unobtrusive method of delivering payloads that bypasses common security measures.
- Benefit: Increases operational success by evading detection from security systems that scan for suspicious binary formats.

**Robust XOR Encryption**
- Description: MagicMerge encrypts executables embedded within images using a dynamically generated 16-byte XOR key, ensuring robust protection against unauthorized access and analysis.
- Benefit: Maintains the integrity and confidentiality of the payload, protecting sensitive data from potential breaches.

**Flexible Deployment Options**
- Description: The tool supports both local and ngrok-enabled public hosting, allowing payloads to be accessed over internal networks or the internet, depending on operational needs.
- Benefit: Offers versatility in deployment, making it suitable for a range of scenarios from controlled internal tests to wide-reaching external deployments.

**Command-Line Interface**
- Description: Operates entirely via a command-line interface, facilitating rapid deployment, scripting, and integration with existing cybersecurity tool chains.
- Benefit: Enhances usability and efficiency, allowing users to execute operations quickly and automate processes as needed.

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**
- Description: Built in Go, MagicMerge is inherently cross-platform, running seamlessly on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Benefit: Ensures consistent performance and functionality across different operating systems, which is crucial for teams working in diverse IT environments.

**Easy Configuration and Customization**
- Description: Simple configuration options via command-line flags enable quick setup and adjustments to fit specific operational requirements.
- Benefit: Allows for easy customization and fine-tuning, improving operational effectiveness and adaptability.

**Dynamic XOR Key Generation**
- Description: Generates a new XOR key for each session, enhancing the security of each encrypted payload.
- Benefit: Prevents the compromise of one payload from affecting others, safeguarding multiple deployments simultaneously.

**Random Image Fetching**
- Description: Automatically fetches a new, random image for each payload from a designated source to ensure each payload is uniquely camouflaged.
- Benefit: Increases security by preventing pattern recognition in payload deliveries, crucial for operations requiring high stealth.

**Flexible Payload Sourcing**
- Description: Allows users to source executables from URLs or local storage, accommodating diverse input needs and operational environments.
- Benefit: Adapts to varying scenarios easily, from centrally managed payloads that can be updated remotely to securely handled local files for restricted environments.
